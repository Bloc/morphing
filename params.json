{"name":"Morphing","tagline":"Become your users","body":"# Morphing\r\n\r\nMorphing is a Rails engine that allows you to morph into your users temporarily. This can be especially helpful when debugging issues reported by a user without needing to log into their account to reproduce.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This library assumes you're using devise.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nAdd the following to your Gemfile:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem 'morphing'\r\n```\r\n\r\nand be sure to ```bundle install``` and add to your routes:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nYourApplication::Application.routes.draw do\r\n  ...\r\n  morphing_for\r\n  ...\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo use the ```morphed?``` helper, Add the following to your ```app/helpers/application_helper.rb```:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmodule ApplicationHelper\r\n  include Morphing::ApplicationHelper\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen place a link somewhere only admins can see:\r\n\r\n```\r\n= link_to \"Morph\", morph_path(@user)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're morphed, you can provide a link to unmorph:\r\n\r\n```haml\r\n- if morphed?\r\n  = link_to \"Unmorph\", unmorph_path\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe recommend making this a big red banner that makes it clear you're morphed! (Future releases will have this included.)\r\n\r\n## Customizing controller behavior\r\n\r\nIf you want to customize the behavior of the controller, for example to add or skip before filters, or to perform authorization, just subclass the MorphingController somewhere in your application:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass MorphingController < Morphing::MorphingController\r\n  authenticate_user! only: [:morph]\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, pass that controller as an argument to the routes helper:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nYourApplication::Application.routes.draw do\r\n  ...\r\n  morphing_for controller: 'morphing'\r\n  ...\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Sponsor\r\n\r\nThis project is sponsored by the engineering team at [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis project is licensed under the [MIT License](MIT-LICENSE).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
